# 🧠 The Notebooks Explained

This web application integrates 3 notebooks which is used for the detection of 3 types of contents uploaded by the user - email's, url's and email's with url's(hybrid).

---

## 📁 `email_training_K.ipynb`: Email Content Phishing Model

This notebook develops a highly accurate model focused on analyzing the linguistic and structural features of email bodies to detect phishing attempts.

**Goal:**  
Classify email text as *Phishing Email* or *Safe Email*.

**Features:**  
Uses **Composite Meta-data and Anomaly Features (CMAF)** — a fusion of **TF-IDF** (word and character n-grams) and manually engineered **meta-features** such as:
- Email length  
- Digit and symbol ratios  
- Number of URLs in the body  
- Presence of urgent terms like “password”, “urgent”, or “account”  

**Model:**  
A **Stacking Ensemble Classifier** combining:
- Logistic Regression  
- Calibrated Linear SVM  
with a **Ridge Classifier** as the final meta-learner.

**Performance:**  
Achieves exceptional performance with a test **AUC = 0.9980**.

**Output:**  
Exports all pipeline components — vectorizers, scaler, base models, stacker, and adaptive threshold — for integration into the fusion pipeline.

---

## 📁 `url_model_training3.ipynb`: Phishing URL Detection Model

This notebook focuses on classifying URLs by analyzing domain characteristics and linguistic patterns. It provides a crucial complementary signal for the hybrid system.

**Goal:**  
Classify a URL as *Malicious* or *Legitimate*.

**Features:**  
Builds a **Hybrid Feature Space** that combines:
- Deep character n-grams (3–5 grams) from the domain string  
- Numeric and semantic features such as domain ranking, ratio metrics, and Jaccard similarity scores  

**Model:**  
An **ElasticNet Logistic Regression Pipeline** (`LogisticRegression(penalty='elasticnet')`), chosen for efficiency and its ability to handle sparse, high-dimensional data.

**Calibration:**  
Incorporates **Conformal Prediction** to compute a nonconformity threshold (`qhat`), ensuring statistical confidence guarantees (e.g., 95% coverage).

**Output:**  
Exports the final trained model, the conformal `qhat` parameter, and an F1-optimized binary threshold to `phishing_hybrid_conformal.pkl`.

---

## 📁 `hybrid_fusion3.ipynb`: Context-Aware Late Fusion

This notebook integrates both the email and URL models to produce a unified phishing risk prediction for an email containing one or more URLs.

**Goal:**  
Combine email content and URL predictions into a single, comprehensive *Phishing Content* or *Safe Content* score.

**Strategy:**  
Implements a **Late Fusion** approach using a weighted average of the individual model probabilities or scores.

**Fusion Logic:**  
The weighting is **dynamic and context-aware**:
- If URLs are present, the URL model is given higher priority (e.g., 60% URL, 40% Email).  
- The weights adapt based on contextual meta-features such as the number of URLs, the presence of suspicious keywords, or anomaly signals.

**Explainability:**  
Integrates **SHAP** and **LIME** for post-hoc interpretability, showing which linguistic or structural features influenced the final hybrid decision.

## 🧩 Summary Of The Models

- **Email Model:** Detects phishing through linguistic patterns and meta-anomalies.  
- **URL Model:** Evaluates domain-level and statistical cues with conformal calibration.  
- **Hybrid Fusion:** Dynamically merges both predictions for context-sensitive detection.

# 🧠 Phishing Detection Datasets

This repository includes two datasets used for training and evaluating phishing detection systems — one focused on **URLs** and the other on **emails**.
Both datasets are publicly available and have been widely used in academic research and real-world phishing detection experiments.

---

## 🔗 1. PhishStorm – URL Phishing Dataset

**Source:** Aalto University (2014)
**File:** `phishstorm_urls.csv`

### 📘 Description

The **PhishStorm dataset** contains a total of **96,018 URLs**, equally divided into **48,009 legitimate** and **48,009 phishing** entries.
Each record corresponds to a unique URL (represented by its domain) and includes a comprehensive set of **engineered features** derived from the work of Marchal et al. (2014).

The dataset is primarily designed for **phishing URL classification** and **real-time streaming analytics** research.

### 📂 Structure

* The `domain` column serves as a unique identifier for each URL.
* The `label` column indicates the classification status:

  * `0` → Legitimate
  * `1` → Phishing
* The remaining columns represent **computed features** introduced in the PhishStorm paper, capturing lexical, host-based, and network-level characteristics of URLs.

### 🧩 Applications

* Phishing URL detection using ML/DL models
* Streaming and online analytics for security monitoring
* Feature engineering and correlation analysis in cybersecurity
* Benchmark dataset for hybrid URL feature-based models

## 📧 2. Phishing Email Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle (S. Chakraborty, 2023)
**File:** `Phishing_Email.csv`

### 📘 Description

This dataset consists of **18,649 email samples** labeled as either **phishing** or **legitimate (ham)**.
It is a clean, English-language dataset derived from publicly available email corpora and refined for phishing detection research.

Each entry contains **email text and metadata**, providing a balanced and realistic representation of real-world email communications.

### 📂 Structure

The dataset includes fields such as:

* `Email ID` – Unique identifier for each email
* `Subject` – Subject line of the email
* `Body` – Email body text (plain or partially cleaned)
* `From` – Sender’s email address
* `To` – Receiver’s email address
* `Timestamp` – Date/time when the email was sent
* `Label` – Classification label (`1` = Phishing, `0` = Legitimate)

Some versions may also include **URLs extracted** from the body and **header fields** such as *Reply-To* or *Return-Path*.

### 🧩 Applications

* Training NLP and transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for phishing detection
* Metadata-based classification (sender/receiver patterns, timestamps)
* Feature extraction for hybrid models (email + URL fusion)
* Statistical and linguistic phishing pattern analysis
